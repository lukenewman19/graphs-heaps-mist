# graphs-heaps-mist

This is a program that takes as input an adjacency matrix that represents cities and their distances apart and outputs 1) a description of the adjacency matrix as if it were a graph with undirected edges, 2) the process of creating a minimum binary heap and then sorting the heap in decreasing order and 3) the minimum spanning tree that connects all cities with shortest possible edges.  I believe it uses Prim's algorithm. 

input file io1.txt corresponds to output file io1_out.txt
input file heap1.txt corresponds to output file heap1_out.txt
input file mist48.txt corresponds to output file mist48_out.txt
and so on...
